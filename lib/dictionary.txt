im going to visit Britain with Britton. Its based on spelling differences
Before twitter I had only ever met one Rebecca or Becca and now I know like 6 or 7 (granted spelling differences, but still)
for those of you who still don't know these spelling differences :):)
It's one of the few spelling differences where Canada lines up with the US instead of UK, but I think "sceptical" is much more elegant.
learning the spelling differences between quit, quite, and quiet... regularenglishprobz
Gurl>Girl...why the spelling differences
If you don't understand the spelling differences between "no","now" & "know".. kill yourself..
Just read the Wiki article on spelling differences between British & American English. Sifo_ gave the Canadian perspective. Thrilling night
not YOU...cute spelling differences!! :)

things must improve, I no longer check the .obj or machine code from the compiler. Pre-processors will improve.

For your code, are you using a mix of interpreted and machine code or just going for bare metal speed with C etc.

Actually, once there is a way to load Guile code into Sorts Mill FontForge, that will be all you need to plug in machine code, too.
I don't see why not, although they try to make you throw away the piece paper with machine code on it.
Why not? It's a common use case. I think it was originally in C because it easily mapped to the increment machine-code instruction.
¬£10 was indeed a fortune. And love the M/C for 'Machine Code' as we all know people sold stuff in Basic LOL
Just write it in machine code! Then you don't need a compiler.
Bytecode is the machine code of the JVM. Java is portable assembly much like C.
..and ALL programming languages are just DSL's over raw machine code!

Yup. You'll need; The Vampire Armand, Merrick, Blood and Gold, Blackwood Farm & Blood Canticle :) Tha's d Vampire Chronicles.
On the next "Vampire Chronicles"
rereading vampire chronicles aka we are one step closer to world damnation.
I JUT THINK THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES ARE A WORK OF PURE BRILLIANCE like how can someone write all of this and not go mad ok
YES THERE IS NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES YES. I love Anne R.
LESTAT AND ALL HIS GAY ROMANCES jfc i hate you why did we get to the vampire chronicles oh god
excuse U BUT MY FIRST ACTUAL NOVELS WERE ANNE RICE vampire chronicles pls
Nap time...as the sun rises!! Vampire chronicles!!
read all Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice :3 she is so amazing
I've become obsessed with the Vampire Chronicles.
they were inspired by The Vampire Chronicles, Vampire Lestat's thought : Beauty was a Savage Garden.
Game of Thrones, Vampire Chronicles, Sherlock Holmes, Romeo and Juliet, Lord of the Rings, Tolkien, Assassin's Creed, Percy Jackson +
Just downloaded Ann rice's vampire chronicles collection. Can't wait to read them! hopemydadwasright when he said they were good!
oh i have a copy :D its the first one of a series i am sure. Not as awesome as vampire chronicles but i like it
Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. She wrote Interview with the vampire,& Queen of the Damned.They're movies too. Good series :)
For my new Followers: 'Nicki' is short for 'Nicolas' a black&white cat named after Nicolas de Lenfant from the Vampire Chronicles. VC
I want to read the entire Vampire Chronicles.
I wanna read 'The Vampire Chronicles.' Yay or nay?
Anne Rices vampire chronicles (I'm collecting all) and John Connolly "DamnItsLeMar: What are some of your favorite books?"
Ann Rice Vampire Chronicles is worth the read. Books are way better than movies and QOTD and Interview With a Vampire will make more sense.
Idly watching Interview With The Vampire & wishing someone would make Tale Of The Body Thief by Anne Rice, fourth in the Vampire Chronicles.
Sudden urge to reread the Vampire Chronicles.
I have a lot of Vampire Chronicles feels. A LOT. XD
How one yearns for the days Anne Rice had an editor and hadn't entirely lost her head. Pre-shark jumping Vampire Chronicles were the shit.
Yep, big reader here. I've been slowly making my way through Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles for like two years now
Wondering.... if you've read any of The Charleston Vampire Chronicles, who is your favorite character?

Just read that the beautiful Anne Rice is apparently returning to the Vampire Chronicles with Claudia's Story!!!!! ;-))
My goal: finish Anne Rice's vampire chronicles & other works. Read Stephen King's collections. Finish my list of contemporary literature.
they're one of the best series I've read! Next to House of Night and the Vampire Chronicles
Christopher Rice has some quite Gothic bits. As do vampire chronicles. They are best books I‚Äôve ever read. V well written.
He is the son of Anne Rice of the Vampire Chronicles fame. Have you read them?
for those particular characters. I love the Vampire Chronicles too, but not keen on QOTD.
far more of the plot of 'The Vampire Lestat' than QOTD. I adore the vampire chronicles.
what about the Morganville Vampire Chronicles? It says 15+ on your website. They're advanced readers, but not sure on content

please rather describe briefly including amount, portions, place, and other ontological information deemed significant
Wtf is an Ontological Argument??? Yikes
Dear 'net, stripping knighthood from a corpse an ontological absurdity. An impossibility. You can't "disagree". You're *wrong*. Look it up.
... but philosophers have shown that such ontological arguments also work in reverse with the opposite result.
Wowzer. And there was me enjoying it, despite my ignorance. I also liked the recent one on the ontological argument. You?
The ontological argument, any hints would be appreciated!
: Also evidence from a rationalist perspective an eg. is G√∂del's ontological proof
I'm tired of thinking about ontological/communicative theories....whelp, time for Spongebob! norelevanthashtagforthistweet

No work from Mrs Fenwick, ontological argument revision from Mr M and case study for AK over half term. Not too bad I suppose
Explain the ontological argument, give an overview, a priori, views of Anselm, Gaunilo, Descartes and Kant. Give your own +
I'm listening to In Our Time about ontological argument. I haven't understood anything after Melvyn Bragg said 'Hello'.
TOO MUCH ONTOLOGICAL HORSE POWER
I am listening to in our time, ontological argument again ;) :D
Actually it's not that much, I just have to write a dramatic script and a paragraph about the ontological argument yay life
Perhaps that is because most news outlets simply repeat the Establishment viewpoint as though it were ontological truth?
Surprised to learn that Kurt G√∂del did his own version of the Ontological Argument, based on Leibniz'. Who knew?
Being exposed to Anselm's Ontological Argument began my interest in Critical Thinking and Philosophy. Thanks, Prof. James Cutsinger.
too ontological to fail. lolwhut latenights
The ontological is sufficient to form the thing, the ontic simply is the thing. The ontological doesn't need to be observed.
right so good the ontic is insufficient to form the thing and the ontological can only exist inasmuch as the person
ontic - only that which exists in the images, ontological - the metaphysical rules inside the film, through which ontic arises
Being able to assume object permanence (or object resurrection) requires a reference to the ontological aspect of the film.
Homework done. Analysis of the Teleological and Ontological Arguments done. Now its time to watch excessive amounts of The Office.
One of the comments on its FB page says "maximally dreadful sweater." I sense a new ontological argument.
somebody tell me the similarities of kant and hume when it comes to the ontological gap
IN OUR TIME podcast: 3 Arguments for God: Ontological; Cosmological; Speleological. Demolished all 3 instantly. QED. NothingToSeeMoveAlong
Sounds good. Current climate may be a good time for academia/everyone to embrace Hakim Bey? The age of Ontological Anarchy!

Strengths and weaknesses with the ontological argument...hmkae.

In that particular act, genuine pleasure from her: he's the object she is using to get off, so let's see her getting off

So I have no particular opinion on *acts* either
FERNS NAMED AFTER GAGA THIS IS FABULOUS
