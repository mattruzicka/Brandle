The Republican Party are genuinely frightening.
I have a few reasons to like Obama, I have a lot of them to not like him & I have absolutely every reason to despise the Republican party
"My Republican Party's full of Racist" Cononel Wilkerson - a Rupublican. I couldn't agree more it's the truth.
Im with you the republican party got hijacked leaving the common folk out in the wind
The republican party has so lost touch with reality that don't even realize how extreme they have become
Truth teller. "My party is full of racists" - Col (Ret) Lawrence Wilkerson to edshow on Republican Party.
the republican party is the old fart in the fast lane, its time to get out of the way so the rest of us can keep moving
The good people in the Republican party and there are some, will likely support Dems in future!
Is there anyone in the Republican Party with moral fiber and the intestinal fortitude to be a man/woman besides Wilkerson and Powell
The entire Republican party must go. Defeat them Nov 6 and we will right the wrongs they have done against the people for the last 2 years.
The Republican Party has hit gutter politics and producing toenail scum to surrogate for Romney!
edshow Before this election is over, expect someone in the Republican party say the N-word.
Well done President Obama for getting the USA out of the deep recession you inherited from Romney's Republican party

Holy Moly!! Col. Lawrence Wilkerson just said on the EdShow that his Republican Party is full of racists who can't accept a black prez.
EdShow Wow- Col. Wilkerson just called out the racists in his Republican party.” Pretty awesome & about time!
edshow Thank you Col. Wilkerson for having the courage the rest of the republican party clearly doesn't have.
edshow Women - don't be fooled into thinking this is "extreme" - this is a plank from the Republican Party Platform!!
the colonel spoke the truth tonight on your show about the Republican party. Romneys silence means he agrees with Sununu.
Republican party is a cold, heartless, bigoted party. Sad but true. That's why the party looks all white. NotCoincident

Thanks everyone!
Your very welcome Anglosphere!
Seems that .ph will be getting the first RuroKen live-action screenings in the Anglosphere, though.
i wish i could check out what they think of video games and wether "otaku" has gotten watered down there like "nerd" in the anglosphere
thanks for the follow!
And what dividing the world into Anglosphere and non-Anglosphere is? cc
Language does not favor the "Anglosphere" Jon. it favors those who speak EN properly, around the world
Language favours the Anglosphere, of which we are a founder member. In a service driven economy language is key
Vous aimez Anglosphere ? Retrouvez-nous aussi sur FACEBOOK !
auspol In the anglosphere, can two political parties have a meeting of differences without been labeled liars?
I've said before, EU are neighbours we talk to over the fence. Anglosphere is our family. Blood thicker than water
...and the US and maybe Ireland. anglosphere is the answer.
Seems to be prevalent in the Anglosphere.
I assume it is not angst about all the farmland owned from the Anglosphere that is driving NFF's wish for a register of foreign-owned land.
The Economist only lists big economies (NZ not incl. e.g.). But most rapidly growing economies are outside the Anglosphere.
Word of the day: “Anglosphere”.
all I'm saying is that which English words are offensive is not the same throughout the Anglosphere
i'm thinking about the i18n implications of this now. the sex number is 69 in the anglosphere, but what about, say, thailand?
Along with the UK & Canada we're all just one big Anglosphere. So decide & vote dammit!
currently invests 116 times as much in US than China.The UK is biggest investor in US&US is biggest in UK.” <Anglosphere
An Anglosphere core but not necessarily a formal block - happy to trade fairly with anyone
In fact, opening the floodgates in the first place was a poor decision. We should have kept them closed except to the Anglosphere.
oh no! The anglosphere will achieve critical mass and collapse in on itself... nothing will escape it's cultural event horizion
Trouble is in the Anglosphere, his films havent been widely released - US, UK, etc.
I am starting to wonder what the Abbott led redneck's foreign policy actually is. Anglosphere?
Overdue a *critical* appraisal frm the Anglosphere esp in the wider context of cinematic history & aesthetics.
Rumour is that the LNP are planning to set up an alternative UN and UNSC in exile on Ellis Island. Only Anglosphere countries can apply.
If the Russian players "hate" America so much,why did you come here to play hockey in the first place?You guys can stay there for all I care

What is more GOP than placing "rights" of religious corporations (churches) over the reproductive rights of individual women? WarOnWomen
Wow! Thx u to all the great gals watching seanhannity. Am proud 2 stand in solidarity w u! We are NOT the sum of our reproductive anatomy!
Abortion and rape aren't that different, tbh. They both have lasting effects on the woman, they both damage her reproductive organs, --
The ad is very juvenile and reflects obama's view of women: It's all about their reproductive organs.
You can pretty much call me anything but spoiled. You call me spoiled, I kick you in your reproductive area.
Wait/what? a retired woman is voting based on her reproductive rights?
I love Planned Parenthood because it is a safe inclusive place that offers accurate education about reproductive health.
Rep. Strategist Ron Christie said womens' reproductive rights/health care are small ball this election. Condescending, rude and incorrect.
Great job on Hannity tonight. Women are more than the sum of their reproductive organs. We have dreams and aspirations.
best part: retiree worrying about her reproductive rights. If post-menopausal, her reproductive rights are at Kinko's.

Andres Serrano's "Piss Christ" doesn't do that for me. So it must not be art....of course I thought that all along.
Reading up on robdelaney Haven't seen so much hub bub about bodily fluids since we studied Andres Serrano's "Piss Christ" in Art School
aún no encuentro la lógica!
Que feo es ver a una amiga sufrir y no poder hacer nada para ayudarla :( se fuerte T.S !

I wonder if Jesse Helms has a Twitter.
when coloreds do things it's shallow. all those votes for George Wallace, David duke +Jesse Helms were purely about substance...

If Romney is elected we can wave goodbye to the NEA and any public programs supporting the arts. We may as well resurrect Jesse Helms.
MSNBC hyperventilates over every imaginary example of "other", so that makes it ok for Obama to go full Jesse Helms. Yeah, I figured.

Paraisopolis, Heliopolis, Jaguaré , Sao Francisco, Vergueirinho e outras ,eu contratei as obras
Serra mencionou Heliopolis. A urbanização começou com a Erundina, caminhou com a Marta e as obras dele foram contratadas no gov Marta
Vamos comprar uma casa em Heliopolis, Capão, Santo Amaro, Itaquera e etc. As favelas em SP são fogo literalmente fogo...
Como o Serra pode falar que não se fazia nada de reurbanização de favelas? Meu trabalho em Heliópolis, com a Erundina, foi um sonho?

You get a warped view of the economy when you use the 250k crowd as your question base.

I guess GOP thks losing 700 K jobs/mo is better than almost 3 years of job growth.
True. How much more growth wld we had if we had bipartianship?

julien donkey boy was dogme 95, i didnt know this!
Buh, sometimes I'm too tied to my reference.....I blame dogme 95 somehow.
I want to get a Dogme 95 bumper sticker, but instead I must find a car where the bumper sticker already exists.
I just figured it out: my personal style is Dogme 95 compliant.
Soliairian and Dogme 95 girl.
Deleon, Knxwledge, Swarvy, Mndsgn, Ohbliv and Ackryte are the Dogme 95 of today's hiphop production or production in general.
I like how the new justinbieber and NICKIMINAJ video mostly adheres to Dogme '95 rules. Von Trier would be proud.
Don't miss THE HUNT. Vinterberg, cofounder of the Dogme 95, earlier made brilliant unsettling films Festen & Submarino. MFF2012
Leave it to Mr_Akbean to know what Dogme 95 is when I start rambling about Breaking the Wave
a good chunk of those are dogme 95 affairs i think
Homeland is on some borderline Dogme 95 shit.
Dogme 95 had set rules for filmmakers. Chuck Jones had set rules for Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner. I know which I'd prefer to watch.
Also an option. That's the pop music and popcorn film of personalities though. I'd rather be post post-rock & Dogme 95.
Dragon's Dogme 95. (There are naked dragons).
Have u seen any Dogme 95 films? Where Lars Von Trier & Thomas Vinterberg began directing
