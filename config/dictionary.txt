@MRichmond5 I will never. If there's one thing that I won't be ignorant of is that Starbucks makes WAY better BREWED coffee than second cup.

@jsbsox So it is possible that Bud brewed in Europe has less alcohol. They could add less adjuncts and have it taste almost the same.
@jsbsox No problem! Guinness Draught brewed/sold in Ire has a lower ABV than Guinness Export due to alcohol taxes. Bud is brewed regionally.

Mixed people probably have the best genes, because it's guaranteed that the two parents will have completely different genetic coding.
@EmilyAnne227 people say there is a gene that can cause it but its not entirely genetic I should get tested or something

RadioLab's boss rebuts  Kau Kalia Yang's essay about the controversial Yellow Rain show. Will print his letter on 5x8 in the morning.
Hi @JadAbumrad. Thank you and @rkrulwich and podcasting technology. I'm slowly and happily dredging thru @Radiolab shows. #poignantscience
@Radiolab The word you are looking for is normality, not normalcy.
...It'd be terrible if @Radiolab hosts started to shy away from asking others, &amp; themselves, uncomfortable questions. Science seeks answers.
Radiolab just taught me: the average person from the Mongolian Empire would have 800 descendants today- Genghis Khan has 16,000,000.
@ashwara haha, me too- reminds me of "the good show" from radiolab
@jadabumrad I've read Kao Kalia Yang's essay abt her experience w/Radiolab &amp; I'm no longer subscribing unless u find a way 2 make this right
@kdern Oh, right, I like Radiolab too! The other one is new to me though -- thanks.
@makingitlovely Radiolab and The Skeptoid. :)
@nathanshinkle NPR's Radiolab is my favorite podcast bar none
@heron_house Personally, I thought the @Radiolab story itself was fair (if fairly abrupt) and that the online apologies seemed genuine.
@ShannonDowney @Radiolab! Because it stirs my curiosity and gets me thinking about big life questions in a pile of new ways. :)
Please tell me I'm not the only one who gets very bummed out listening to some of the really sad stories on @Radiolab.
Can anyone link me to an article detailing the controversy of @Radiolab's episode about YellowRain? #Hmong
@whitneyarner Which one? Radiolab?
@ejwillingham the @Radiolab yellow rain story?  that was a wild interview!  do tell if you find out anything new!

The search for truth isn't always pretty.I stand with @Radiolab in this controversy. How many even knew about the Hmong before this aired?
Catching up on some podcasts now. You already know this, but damn, Radiolab is good.
New Radiolab! This makes me very happy.
Trump = racist. Radiolab = a staggering lapse in judgment. I just don't see how you can put the two entities in the same category. YMMV.
Radiolab and sunset drives and this team. The road is too good.
@radiolab, love the new shorts! Any plans on releasing the live show on video for those far far away who couldn't see it in person?
Listen to 4 strait #radiolab episodes today then watched Sherlock Holmes.  so naturally my brain is wondering what the hell just happened

shows like mythbusters and podcasts like radiolab are great, but very dangerous. don't take everything they say as the truth.
@Radiolab's Robert Krulwich, who shows he is not a compassionate human being, should shove his disingenuous apology up a bee's pooping ass.
@ninabyte F it I am posting my question on "Goodbye, Radiolab"!!! The pursuit of non-academic edification ftw
@kristenschaaled I listened to Kristen Schaal is a horse on @Radiolab and now all I ever want to do is watch that video.
@mattthomas @nathanjurgenson Thanks for noting the Radiolab piece -- and highly interesting back and forth you two had about the show.
.@RadioLab get your shit together.
@ninabyte SHOOWEEEEE. That is some difficult stuff to wrestle with (the Yellow Rain radiolab blogs) but I'm glad I read it.

Radiolab stepped in bee poop.
really felt uncomfortable after that interview. first and last radiolab episode i listened to.
If you've been following Radiolab's mistreatment of its Hmong guests, I highly recommend The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down.
Time for #radiolab with The Fact of the Matter.
@WNYC NOT enough time to talk about accountability for @Radiolab's mistreatment of Yang, her uncle, and the issue of the Hmong genocide!
@Radiolab does someone really have to get a court order for you to release unedited interview w #Hmong survivor? Pls share their story
@Radiolab is as good as it gets.

@eboustead Ditto. And yes, by way of the Radiolab debacle!

Radiolab is likely to have its Tour de France titles erased and Nike sponsorship terminated.
NYC literary media golden white boys fudge their facts to shocking degrees and usually hold onto their careers quite easily. #radiolab
I think it is funny that people are so surprised at #radiolab . Media that excludes women and POC does this kind of stuff.
That self-satisfied white boy NYC media darling thing strikes again w/radiolab. Same phenom as Jonah Lehrer etc. Just--even uglier.
Whoa, Radiolab. I am so disgusted. This kind of talk about high journalistic principles while rolling like pigs in ego and privilege.
So amazing. I am still thinking about it. @BabyShrink @RadioLab
@SpinsterAndCat @Radiolab @heySMM LMFAO&amp;SMMFH I haven't heard "Whitelandia" in too long. Need to re-introduce it to my vocabulary.

@wendymac @Radiolab @EthanZ tweezing out the privilege of storytelling &amp; value structure of science v. experience is important work
@Radiolab your cruel and insensitive story/interview on "Yellow Rain" is outrages... radiolab = RACIST...

@KMBTweets @Radiolab @heySMM "Where are your credentials? Oh-you have them? Oh, but they're not from Whitelandia, so they don't count!"

@Radiolab Question: How come your stitcher feed is different from your NPR BROADCAST (Chicago) has not updated in a while with a full show?
@annehelen @FayebellineW @rebeccaonion I haven't listened to that episode because I found Radiolab almost completely unlistenable from the +
@rebeccaonion @FayebellineW Agreed. I haven't heard it either, but I also stopped listening to Radiolab for that reason.
I can't believe it has taken me this long to listen to RadioLab's Time episode. What an amazing show. #WNYC
horrified @ #radiolab. i liked their attempt at popular sci/tech coverage despite their smarminess. wtf. #racism #hmong #endwar
I'm so gonna listen to Radiolab, even if it means sleeping an hour less. Just today.
Even @Radiolab needs anti-oppression workshops on how white privilege manifests into the exploitation of the "experiences" of the "other"
was so disturbed when I heard @Radiolab's piece on Yellow Rain. everything I've read by Janet Malcolm came rushing back to me, shrieking...
@llapen hey!! What exactly is @radiolab??
"We have many modes. We can be different people at different times." Jad Abumrad of @RadioLab to @BrianLehrer. Fascinating chat on @WNYC.
@dwescott1 what were they not apologising for? I'm not familiar with radiolab
I love @Radiolab, but Robert Krulwich's treatment of Kao Kalia Yang &amp; her uncle during the Hmong Yellow Rain segment was reprehensible.
@Radiolab get ready for some great costume photos from @ASRVoice, @WIUX and @wfhb at our storytelling event on Saturday!

How do we learn a language; behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism, learning and acquisition.
The Grammar-Translation Method | Chomsky theory (Cognitivism)
Cognitivism:- Brain | Chomsky | L2 learned fast with L1.
How do pupils learn language? Here are some of the major theories:- Behaviourism, Cognitivism, Humanism, Learning and acquisition.
Cognitivism can be used in web design when it asks users to read through and process information before they apply it to a problem or task
Cognitivism can be used for a web design by considering the factors in understanding Jean Piaget, which is:
Cognitivism can be used to create websites by making people recall things in different ways. By playing a game, being asked a question etc.
@RickWarren This Man and his staff will change your life@Saddleback
Cognitivism is a counter and offers a much needed response to the antiquated notion that human beings are atomatrons and learn in one way.
This is issue of cognitivism is interesting especially since I run a fb page page with words cognitive pathology in it.
behaviourism - cognitivism - humanism -learning &amp; acquisition
EDUI 6110 - Cognitivism can be applied in web design by making simulation-based web activities.
Cognitivism is use of schema and stages of cognitive development.  The tasks based on stage of cogn. dvlpmt, w/ visuals, or actions.
@SureLoves1D ahah I have a psychology class, so behaviorism and cognitivism are 2 approaches that we study. I have an given situation (c)
read half of a thirty page article and still don't understand what non-cognitivism really is, so making the executive decision to give up.
@Mely_glez wtff=( y que dice jean piaget entonces? nadamas cognitivism? ni se que significa eso!
@paulinarzamudio y porque no lo anotaste tu pueh jajaj JP-cognitivism , LK moments. Y LK lo dividi√≥ en levels I, II y III pero has de cuenta
@Mely_glez siii peroo la michelle me estaba anotandoo! yy no tengo el apunte completo, no tengo la escalera, y tengo cognitivism y
@americaalamilla eso que me pasaste lo tengo en estructural cognitivism y segun yoo era de jeanpiaget, esqe la michelle me lo escribio,nose
@paulinarzamudio mira el de jp es de cognitivism el de una escalerita, no se los dibujo? y el de LK es de moments, est√° dividido en levels
Cognitivism is used in web design through games, videos, and by building the foundation of knowledge in order to learn more difficult skills
cognitivism: all behav is determined by thought. behav is brain's attempt to achieve a specific goal in the most efficient or effective way.
@likeavirJANE what's cognitivism?
Behaviorism, Cognitivism, Constructivism limit people to what they are, while Connectivism looks at their potential. #ed103
Considering the applications of connectivism, constructionism, and cognitivism in my final project. Not as easy as behaviorism! #ed103
@jimljosh may meaning ka ng cognitivism? :))
The information processing model of the human brain needs to change into cognitivism :) #kmw12
Cognitivism can be used in web design by considering and utilizing schema, and applying it with and to new knowledge.
‚Äú..it is rare to see cognitivism sit so pretty in the lap of psychoanalysis‚Äù {following which much embarrassment was had}
Very intense conversation, with Dr. in psychology, on the subject of cognitivism. Justin Bieber playing in the background: weird!
Introduction to Cognitivism
#COGNITIVISM
@aziaticblack if that makes sense...like, if we existed in a white room with no stimuli or experiences, we would have limited consciousness
like instant self-consciousness if i haven't seen someone for a while.
@MastinKipp HAAAA! I knew it! Talk about stream of consciousness reporting...."She follows him on Twitter!" Coffee hadn't kicked in!
his consciousness is not a weight, rather a lens to train deeper understanding on virtuous vice, on the aims and pitfalls of a generation...
Faded way too long, I'm floating in and out of consciousness.
but consciousness would have to have a conscious...... and that makes no sense. but the universe has a conscious so who knows man.
Blood what if our consciousness chose or brains to control. (looks around and nothing makes sense anymore)
Conscious is..... where? Its not in my head so it's not part of my body, right? So we're not connected to our consciousness?
As the earth consciousness evolves the crystals are taking in the new energy, some are even fully activated from ancient information
God-consciousness should be manifested through purposeful actions
@JG_CockDiesel my un tired consciousness tells me to do it for fun, but my fatigue hinders my ability :(
My consciousness tells me to attempt to fall asleep, but my cognizance tells me otherwise. #collegessays #philo #insomniac

Why is my brother learning about in depth sexual reproduction in the 6th grade? And we wonder why kids in America are so screwed up...
Asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction, homologous, diploid,haploid,meiosis, crossing over, tetrad, gamete,mitosis, karyotype
Hey, after Christmas break guess what I get to learn about? Sexual reproduction.
Sexual reproduction of moulds, kinky ;) #ilbeyourzygospore

Learning about sexual reproduction in bio...how can you not stay awake @SarahBearah0414!?!?!?
To quote Professor Kittlesen, "Many Biologists see sexual reproduction and think variety." #kinkyscience

Oh you're pregnant? I Thought you went to college to learn something. Not to get a masters in sexual reproduction
but i don't wanna study sexual reproduction &amp; illicit drugs :(
@TJAW96 @ilivefororeos meiosis is actually the special cell division needed for sexual reproduction in the eukaryotes
In biology, sexual reproduction is a process of combining and mixing genetic traits,

Y'all ever seen the sexual reproduction of chickens?  Here.  üê§üí¢üêî.........üê£..........üê•

@Si_Sir13 I don't believe in sexual reproduction
@TheQueenRegnant No tumors are not life. Yes, sexual reproduction matters entirely. You cite science and yet science backs us up.
@GeminiJoshix LOOOOOL! It will be born from the process of meiosis, where sexual reproduction is used to produce a zygote.
@Boiler_Miker Yes, I know that. The sexual reproduction doesn't matter to this argument. Is it NOT LIFE ALSO?
@TheQueenRegnant Cancer tumors have an abnormal set of DNA, but not unique sets brought on by sexual reproduction. There are multiple

@amzyami Not sure, Observational Learning kot. Tapi that case macam more untuk relate dengan Self-Socialization :/
animals use observational learning by modifying their existing behaviors after observing other animals of their kind #psychology
@DEdwardBrown naw...just observational learning...I seen it happen over night
I have to a Psych project where I explain observational learning through my own life experiences and I do everything observationaly so...
so now I'm trying to research observational learning but can't find anything about errors made by conspecifics; only learning useful skills.
Observational learning: Learning new behaviors or information by watching others. Example: Bandura's Famous Bobo Doll Study
@jamierose08 yesszir. use the observational learning theory for an example.
Albert Bandura is the psychologist most strongly identified with observational learning which is learning through viewing others #chap5

@Terrel3892Will You already have Summa Theologica for reference. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶heavy.  Reitan‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs God a Delusion?‚Äù is pretty good. Rereading it.
Doctrina Christiana, Summa Theologica, Santo Evangelio.

@kesslerbs Nah.  He's shooting for the marathon record whilst reading Atlas Shrugged... er, um... the Summa Theologica.

Just 1/2 of country! ‚Äú@JoshDorner: Mike Murphy, echoing Romney political dir., calls women's health, pay equity "small things" #obama2012
‚Äú@TeaPartyCat: Romney campaign: "Pay equity is nothing but an effort to help trial lawyers. And women, I guess."‚Äù @HEK_pikapp
Pay equity only applies to female lawyers? MT @thinkprogress: Romney surrogate says pay equity "nothing but an effort to help trial lawyers"
Possessing the privilege in this country that comes with a penis, Marco Rubio tells women that ensuring pay equity is‚Ä¶ https://t.co/jIWkGnux
Marco Rubio doesn't like pay equity legislation because it's just a conspiracy to pay women equally.
Romney campaign: "Pay equity is nothing but an effort to help trial lawyers. And women, I guess."
"@thinkprogress: Top Romney surrogate says pay equity is "nothing but an effort to help trial lawyers" no need for attys if there was equity
Not shocked that Rubio says pay equity is just a gift to trial lawyers. That's what ALL Republicans say.
Mike Murphy, echoing Romney political director, calls women's health, pay equity "small things." #mtp
And, Romney avoid whether any of the women hired, however briefly, had pay equity in their jobs b/c he doesn't believe in that #nerdland
Romney NOT on the side of women.Against reproductive rights,will eliminate cancer screening byPlannedParenthood,doesntsupport pay equity.
@splendidhammer Ledbetter is about enabling more people to sue, and in some cases that's helped indivs, but it has not changed pay equity.
.@splendidhammer It's just that the Ledbetter case is not about women's pay equity. Other cases are, and are better.
.@splendidhammer That's a very good thing. As a woman I've fought for pay equity all of my  working life.  -&gt;
Just wondering if women who support Mitt Romney know that he actively voted against pay equity? #Bindersfullofwomen
Obama's answer on pay equity for women was awesome, but since overshadowed by "binders full of women" comment
Both candidates have failed to fully close the pay equity gap. @LAHSAseniors
.@ddye022 @lauradonovanua @katieatodd Derek no argument with me. Do you or don't you support pay equity for women?
Women's Group Launches Pay Equity Attack In Nevada (VIDEO)TPMThe PAC associated with EMILY's List is going on air with an ad in the...
It irritates me that in all the "binders full of women" talk, it gets lost that Mitt said nothing about actual pay equity for women

Premier Redford is addressing the 2012 AUPE Annual Convention today at 11:30.  This is an amazing year of firsts. What's next? Pay Equity?
Lilly Ledbetter spoke to women voters re Romney on CNN. Women's economic issues go beyond jobs: pay equity, contraception, abortion rights.
@BrianMerritt does this speak more to pay equity/parity? Or that there are fewer upper level female staffers.? #bothareproblematic
Really Romney? Issues of pay equity, social justice, trust are just "silly word games?" You are out of touch! #romnesia #forward
Please GOP, keep calling issues like Pay Equity "small things" and "shiny objects" So helpful to make the case for Obama. #Romnesia
Just can't comprehend #MittRomney's female supporters. No pay equity, a return to kitchen table abortions, and pregnant and barefoot.
You would think pay equity would be an easy lay up for any politician. #Uppers
@upwithchris Why focus only women w/children on the Pay Equity. Women w/o kids are affective as well. Tired of kid centric focus. #uppers

#WeCantDateIf you still adhere to the Julian calendar.
"313 ships required we're at 285" - last night's debate. The next 24 hrs is DAY 285 in the JULIAN calendar. 313 takes us to 11/8 Gregorian.

#HeWantsTheP, sexual reproduction talk in bio today. #nobigdeal.
Sexual Reproduction. Why is it called sexual? Is there another kinda reproduction or something ?
@JennyKawaguchi Sexual reproduction? You're welcome. :D
@Riku_KHRP we're talking about sexual reproduction in biology‚Ä¶with lots of freshmen‚Ä¶imiture freshmen‚Ä¶‚Ä¶kill me.
Professor said we will watch a movie over human sexual reproduction. 

Basically we are about to watch a porno.
My instructor on sexual reproduction..... First comes first let's get this out of the way. "Penis penis penis, vagina vagina, vagina!"
Bio prof: "Why do you think humans reproduce via sexual reproduction vs. asexually?" Guy in back: "Because it feels good!" haha
So wait everything in life is just about sexual reproduction
Asexual and Sexual Reproduction of plants,Herbal Plants. &gt; Mga hw ng kapatid ko na ako gagawa -__________-
@saifadotcom no. I'll write the whole chapter of sexual reproduction. No need to thank me.
@JoeCienkowski 1200 Ma. When first sexual reproduction began.

Mitosis, meiosis, and sexual reproduction is making me sleepy. I think it's time for a nap lol
@LawTooRaw ask her what her genetic background is...
My dad is ripped, and my mom weighed like 90 pounds all throughout high school.. I guess I inherited all of moms genetic traits. #Skeleton
Genetic test tomorrow yay.
Math should be a genetic thing. My dad was a math teacher...in Mexico ._.

Homosexual scientists... have been desperately trying to prove this spiritual disorder is genetic for some time.
Lol people are the most clueless things in the world , how clear must I be for you to understand it ? Stupidity isn't genetic
Homosexuality IS NOT genetic.

It is a disorder on a spiritual level .. it involves unnatural energy.
@hotmommaxtina I ccouldnt get approved nor could my mother 4 the genetic testing,&amp; my mother was dying of stage 4 inflammatory breast cancer
Maybe it's genetic.....
I really hope the urge to procrastinate every 5 seconds isn't genetic because if so i feel really bad for my future children
@Nino_Negrino A genetic mutation favored by natural selection in people who weren't able to get much sunlight.
@Nino_Negrino A genetic mutation that began in the Whites, lol.

After screening Genetic Roulette it has impact me in so many ways including my future trips to the grocery store.
Wow. Lactose intolerance was the original state of humans. It was a genetic mutation that made some humans able to digest dairy products.
syamil dah nak habes study genetic.cuak jap.*saiko*
@rwherrion10 beginning to sound like your old man, my friend. #genetic
Do u believe our human behaviour is because of genetic inheritance or environmental factors ???
If we look at it from a scientific perspective, sex is nothing more than genetic shuffling. But don't call it that on dates. Trust me.
@I_am_Ozma Bad news is that he may grow into Marmaduke, depending on his genetic heritage!
@freimyberger fuckin moodle ruined my life omg. p.s your dna model will go down in genetic class history #nicework #overachiever #whatisdna

Must be genetic.
"zodiac signs are genetic"
BUT the baby is so freakin adorable ! i coulda given better genetic features tho . ok , im done being a hater .

Is it a genetic failing that I love beef so much? Cheese? Fried things? #nowillpower¬†
pretty sure Brazilians have a genetic predisposition to being downright sexy
Bi*** so evil..especially when they are playing with the genetic engineering things
didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
Wake evrybody nomore sliping in there I so feel good luv yall
@hollaitshannahk hahahaha @lex_kimker6 said she understood it and Doxsey screamed IT'S GENETIC! I almost died laughing
Mankind got stupider at scary rate.. hoped genetic engineering would fix it, but greatest minds focused on hairloss and erections #Idiocracy

@bulletproofexec I'm 17 and balding, is this purely genetic or can it be a dietary problem? You were great on the Joe Rogan Exp. btw!
@Daggy1 No one hates you.. You're just not that smart! Ur republican, that denotes lost chromosomes in your genetic make up.. Not Ur fault
in high school, my teachers thought i was smoking stress.

ugliness and fatness are genetic disorders, much like baldness or necrophilia
Will, it's genetic @shleeaye @theresa_marieee
bitch i see through your mascara, your fake and your genetic makeup is to get your cake up but your personality is tasteless
#FavoriteMovieQuote At Globo Gym we understand that "ugliness" and "fatness" are genetic disorders, much like baldness or necrophilia
@wait_wait_what Their genetic material (even carrier genes) aren't diverse enough.

@Genetic_Win both
I like the idea that characteristics are all just genetic mutations. Essentially, we are all freaks.
this lifestyle is going against my genetic imperative
I clearly don't give a hot shit. It's in my nature. Genetic i think

Sooo I just saw my new top favorite musical, repo! A genetic opera
Repo! The Genetic Opera - Chase The Morning
Watched a video earlier about bringing dinosaurs back to life through genetic cloning. Why not do that on people...?
Putting off my genetic homework is possibly the worst decision I have made all year #Senioritis #ReadyToGraduate
Recently discovered "Repo! The Genetic Opera." The soundtrack is strangely addicting. Anthony Steward Head has a voice made of gold.
@RaineSN7 Guess it's genetic then. -draws small doodles of the crew, the Normandy, N7 logo, and more of the symbols-
@kutiieee09 My eyes low cause of genetic defects I don't smoke illegal substances.

Lol
i think theyre genetic ! :) "@_BlkNBeautiful_: I love my dimples I hope my kids have them to ‚ò∫"
So, I have this thing called PFAPA and apparently it's a genetic mutation. Doesn't that make me feel cool... Hahaha
Kena setup new lab for animal genetic .. Jom kita bershopping.. Hoyeayyy!!!
@Spacestu22 Or we have genetic engineering by then and it's the other way around. :D
@NdemicCreations so how exactly do you unlock new genetic sequences without buying them?
@jodiapplekay thats messed up how #pix11news studios  set up Lionel behind the heading " Genetic Freak " The egghead of NotreDame .
its 2012 y have we not found a way to make a genetic replica of ed sheeran
@cmeenuh I'm pretty sure no guy can say that either. Let's be honest, that man is a genetic gift.
I have lipodystrophy and not many people have this rare genetic disorder.
Yeh for translation, long live genetic code! Lol
Is genetic manipulation really that controversial of a subject?
@DawnRiseth Interesting subject.Maybe tech.should compliment us (bionics, cloning parts),not engulf us (genetic modification &amp;/or mutation)?
Mixed people probably have the best genes, because it's guaranteed that the two parents will have completely different genetic coding.
@EmilyAnne227 people say there is a gene that can cause it but its not entirely genetic I should get tested or something

Biologi haploid dan diploid ga ngerti ._.v
I've surprised myself, I've sat here and done work on 'haploid' and 'diploid' cells for the past hour and i actually understand it:)
Iya kuliah dimana ? "@karlinawidyaan: @dahliamalys Mau tau ngga dah? 'Dua haploid' nanti mau kuliah dmn?"
@dahliamalys Mau tau ngga dah? 'Dua haploid' nanti mau kuliah dmn?
@lishellaasc sama deh._. Eh, mulai oosit sekuder sampai kebawah2nya sampai sel telur itu haploid kn?
Iya"@Angellgoh: @lishellaasc !! :D spermatosit sekunder tu haploid y?"
@lishellaasc !! :D spermatosit sekunder tu haploid y?
Okay so mitosis produce a diploid cell which is equivalent to 2n whereas meiosis produce a haploid cell which is equivalent to n #StudTweet
@farquead in bio my teacher makes us say "diploid is a penis and the cum is haploid"
Terbentuk 4 sel anakan haploid
Telofase 2: kromatid dikutub berubah jd benang2 kromatin,membran nukleus &amp; inti haploid terbentuk,kromosom jd benang kromatin,sitokinesis jd
Metafase 2: kromosom haploid tertarik ke bdg ekuator, terbentuk benang2 spindel, salah 1 ujungnya melekat pd sentromer
Meiosis 2: terjadi pembagian kromatid tunggal dr setiap kromosom haploid kpd sel anakan
Telofase1:retikulum endoplasma mmbentuk membran inti,nukleolus mulai terbentuk,trjadi sitokinesis menjadi 2 sel ank dgn kromosom sdh haploid
Membran sel mulai melekuk di bagian tengah, tujuan anafase 1 = membagi isi kromosom diploid menjadi haploid
Meiosis mengalami pembelahan inti 2x sehingga satu sel diploid menghasilkan 4 sel haploid. Tahapannya ada meiosis 1 &amp; meiosis 2
@ruthburr I'm also seeing a lot of writing for Haploid...hmmm
Dah habis bab meiosis II baru aku ingat apa haploid nd diploid. Lol pity me.
@Brookekincart  yup... I keep hearing hippo when he says haploid... #oopsies #hipposonmymind
Meiosis , mitosis , diploid , haploid (€≥¬∫Ã©Ã©ÃÅ–î¬∫Ã©Ã©ÃÄ)€≥
Haploid 1 diploid 2
@rickyraharja_ haploid single... Diploid dobel
@murtirhmi Baru sampe kromosom haploid :')
@sarahmat96 dude klau aku ber haploid diploid dgn kau, yang palisade, cuticle ni sapa nak hafal? -.-
@ian_ichsan @satriaspradana @timhore_biologi iya sih -,- kan si haploid jantan ketemu haploid betina dulu baru mitosis ya
@Nrnashraaaaa halllo dude cite weyh pasal diploid n haploid yg u citer kt faiz :)
@rifskysky @SatriaSpradana @TimHore_Biologi gw jg aga lupa praktis dunia nyatanya, tapi kan dr definisinya haploid lebih ga mgkin meiosis
@haploid Vous avez test√© @polagram ? √ßa va vous plaire, on vous a envoy√© un code promo le 16, profitez-en !
@satriaspradana @ian_ichsan @timhore_biologi bentar, emang yg haploid masih mitosis ya? o_O *lupa
@TimHore_Biologi @SatriaSpradana yg tidak bisa terjadi pada sel haploid, MEIOSIS, udah (n) ga bisa di setengahin lagi kan
min,proses yang tidak dapat terjasi pd sel haploid ?? #tanyahore
Homologous sister chromatid centromere spindle fibre haploid diploid jadahnye kena hafal semuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
@Tamirizt kayaknya iya... Ahaha yg gue inget cuma mitosis itu diploid, kalo meiosis haploid :va
@JoeiSumiller give the meaning of the ff: chromosomes, cell division, haploid, diploid, homologous chromosomes, polyploidy, gametes
@chinaabriol chromosomes, cell division, haploid, diploid, homologous chromosomes, polyploidy, gametes
Haploid? Why not fulloid #failloser
Damn.. Learning biology is lame. #monohybridcross #homozygous #heterozygous #genotype #phenotype #alleles #mitosis#meiosis #diploid #haploid
@Saman_AliM um i tried to find it but i couldnt so i wrote e. because during meiosis there are haploid cells right? she said she would post
Diploade and Haploid
Kalo Diploid membelah jadi haploid, kalo haploid membelah jadi halfploid -_- lol
@Ismaaaat95 @georginaknightx @joeclarkyyy @FarhaanJayy @RedAcee 'haploid', I won't y'all a chocolate. I deserve a thanks?

@Haziotkelson mitosis produce new cell diploid, meiosis produce gamate haploid. belum hbis exam?

ingat bro meiosis sel anak haploid mitosis diploid ya
@martinagkml wkwkwkwk yoi tin.. Kt sm kyk meiosis ud haploid dri awal  ahahaha

@aracelijaimes_ LOLZ! Technically he exists because we are holding half of his chromosome number lol xD 
Haploid I believe?
@Inespepe2013 seriously ...  mitosis is 2 haploid daughter cells right.. and meiosis is 4 ?
Haha udah haploid aja kaya resta ;;) "@meykumeyy: @ntaresta iya engga dateng-dateng aja, pengen ganti jadi diploid haha"
Enya laah :p oh begitu? Ekekek "@meykumeyy: @reregogo haha iya gtu anak muda ? nya lagi haploid weh :p"
@reregogo haha iya gtu anak muda ? nya lagi haploid weh :p
Iya anak tua, ahaha kan aku lebih muda darimu kak :p why? "@meykumeyy: @reregogo apaaah? tua ? -.- engga nak lagi haploid ~"
@reregogo apaaah? tua ? -.- engga nak lagi haploid ~
Haploid yo stomach
@marystank okay, so crossing over happens in meiosis, not mitosis, crossing over helps to create genetic diversity in a haploid cell
@shakearifin eh? Oh mmg la sexual reproduction kan, haploid campur haploid, pastu ada crossing over tu campur tu, bagus2
meiosis 1 + meiosis 2 = 4 haploid daughter cells right? #APBioProbs

@mrsjohnsmith_ omg , kus it is .. idk if its my pregnancy but damn ive been through hell and feel like shit..
Okay brain, the whole "let's keep the pregnancy weight gain in check" concept doesn't flow with craving cheese dip. Can't we crave grapes?
A study finds that there may be few differences in pregnancy-related results for women who gain more or less weight.
I love my kids but I bet I won't have another one. My hubby is fixed and Pregnancy is too hard.
@ShiMbiir for that asshole to say that SHE should keep a pregnancy that is out if rape and just take it as gods well!? Yo that's bullshit

@austinhasaids haha he's a satiric rapper, shock value goes a long way.
@MRDIZASTER diz vs lux... Please! Dizasters delivery alone would end lux's career... Funny how crowd reaction and shock value decide success

The acting is abysmal, and it seems like the show relies entirely on shock value and "spooky" imagery rather than quality product.
@thinkprogress She and Ann Coulter do this for shock value.  If you don't talk about it, you take away any power they have. They are boring.
@anncoulter needs to just go away and die. Stop using the r-word for shock value

@TWDConfessions true. Good for the shock value though, all part of the shows allure.

@philiplovesyou Thats what you get for going for shock value
@JakeIstKrieg i think the "joke" is hazy at best &amp; mostly relies on shock value inherent in the word "vagina" and the commodifying of same
@GhostPanther True. And if I'm being honest, Bronson Pinchot was for shock value. I'm not convinced he has an opinion on anything.
@StrokeMyDreads let's hope he doesn't WWE could do it for shock value
@JStac825 lmk, I need the opinion of someone that's gonna listen to what was said, not shock value and jokes. Lyricism.
